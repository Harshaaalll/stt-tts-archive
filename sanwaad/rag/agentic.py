"""Agentic RAG: let retrieval decide whether it succeeded, and retry if not.

Ordinary RAG retrieves once and hopes. It has no way to notice that it pulled
five plausible-looking clauses, none of which answer the question — and the
generator downstream will write a confident reply from whatever it was handed.

Agentic RAG closes that loop: retrieve, *assess coverage*, and if the answer
is not in hand, reformulate and go again. The word "agentic" just means the
retrieval step gets to make a decision instead of being a fixed pipeline
stage.

The cost discipline that makes it practical: assess with a free heuristic
first and only spend a model call when the heuristic is uncertain. A design
that calls an LLM to grade every retrieval doubles your per-case spend to fix
the minority of cases that were wrong.
