"""Agent contracts: who owns each step, what it reads, writes and may call.

A multi-agent system is only debuggable if every agent has a defined role, an
input contract and an output contract. Without them you have several prompts
passing a dictionary around, and when a field comes back wrong nobody can say
which agent wrote it.

Sanwaad is a multi-agent system with CENTRALISED orchestration: the LangGraph
state machine owns the control flow, and each agent is a node that reads a
declared slice of state and writes a declared slice back. No agent calls
another agent directly. That single rule is what keeps coordination overhead —
the main cost of going multi-agent — bounded.

Three things here are enforced, not just documented:

- WRITES   `check_writes` runs on every node's output (see graph.py). A node
           that writes a key outside its contract fails loudly in tests,
           instead of silently overwriting another agent's conclusion.
- TOOLS    the tool registry refuses a call from an agent whose contract does
           not list that tool. Least privilege is a lookup, not a convention.
- OUTPUTS  each agent's `output` names the pydantic model its result must
           validate against; the LLM layer rejects anything that does not.

`reads` is documentation. Enforcing it would mean proxying state access on
every node, which costs more clarity than it buys; it is kept accurate by
review and by the trajectory evals, which fail when a step acts on something
it should not have seen.
