"""Guardrails: the checks that run whether or not the model cooperates.

A guardrail is not a prompt instruction. Prompt instructions are requests; a
guardrail is code that runs after the model has spoken and can still refuse.
The distinction matters because everything here defends against the case where
the model does the wrong thing, which is exactly the case where asking it
nicely has already failed.

Three positions, and they are not interchangeable:

  INPUT   before the text reaches any model — untrusted customer content
  OUTPUT  after generation, before anything is published
  ACTION  before an irreversible effect (posting, calling, moving money)

Sanwaad's existing gates are ACTION guardrails (`auto_post_allowed`) and a
model-based OUTPUT guardrail (the grounding check). This module adds the
deterministic ones, which are cheaper, faster and cannot themselves be talked
out of it.
