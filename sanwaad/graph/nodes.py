Comments arrive in English, Hindi (Devanagari), Hinglish written in Latin script,
and other Indian languages. Read them as an Indian support lead would.

Set `severity` on customer impact, not on tone:
  1  mild annoyance, no money at stake
  2  routine issue, small amount, no deadline pressure
  3  real money blocked or lost, customer inconvenienced
  4  large amount, repeated contact, or account fully inaccessible
  5  regulatory, legal, fraud, or safety exposure

`summary` MUST be written in English regardless of the comment's language, in
one sentence, naming the amount and timeframe if present. This summary is used
verbatim as a retrieval query against an English policy index, so write it with
the vocabulary a policy document would use.

`language` is the BCP-47 tag of the language to REPLY in, mirroring the
customer. Hinglish in Latin script is "hi-Latn"."""
