"""Graph assembly: the orchestration layer.

Why a state machine instead of one large system prompt: the existing voice
agents in this repo carry a `_TERMINATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION` with capitalised
FORBIDDEN clauses, which is what prompt engineering looks like when it is
being asked to do a control-flow job. Phase transitions belong in edges, where
they are deterministic, inspectable, and testable without spending a token.

Autonomy is not the same as lack of structure. Most of this flow is known in
advance, so it is a pipeline with explicit branches — retry loops, approval
gates, fallback paths — rather than an agent loop deciding its own next step.
Models make judgements INSIDE nodes; code decides which node runs next.

Every node is wrapped so its output is checked against its contract in
`agents.AGENTS`. A node writing state it does not own fails immediately,
which is the difference between a multi-agent system and several prompts
overwriting one dictionary.
