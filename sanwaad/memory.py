"""Memory design is data architecture.

"Memory" is not one thing, and the most common mistake is to treat it as one —
usually by pouring all of it into a vector database. Sanwaad keeps eight kinds
of remembered data, and each lives where its ACCESS PATTERN says it should:

  state              what one case in flight knows right now
  working            short-lived, bounded, cross-case scratch space
  knowledge          retrieved per step, never stuffed into every prompt
  episodic           what happened before that should shape what happens next
  audit              what happened, for people asking afterwards
  system of record   business truth, owned by the application, reached by tools

For every kind this module states: where it is stored, what it holds, how long
it is kept, whether it may reach a model, and what happens to personal data.
Retention is enforced by `prune()` for the file-backed stores; the checkpoint
database's retention is declared but not yet enforced (see DESIGN.md, exercise 3).

    python -m sanwaad.memory           the map, and what pruning would remove
    python -m sanwaad.memory --apply   actually prune
